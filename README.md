# Brian Kruse Individual Project - Driving Assistant

### Problem Statement

How often do you see someone weaving in and out of traffic 15 miles over the speed limit just to get stuck at the same stoplight at you? Most people think if you drive 10% faster you'll get somewhere 10% faster but how could you possibly know? This application will track your driving patterns and the give you valuable information about routes you've taken.

The user can drive as they normally would, and after following the same route several times, the application can return statistics based on average speed and time to location, and amount of time saved. This information can inform the user and alter driving patterns e.g. will going 5 miles per hour faster actually get you to work on time. 

### Project Technologies/Techniques
* Login and Authentication
  * User accounts due to different driving patterns for different people
  * Without login only application information available
* Database (MySQL and Hibernate)
  * Store users and user preferences
  * Stores data on routes, route times, route speeds
* Web Services and APIs
  * Google Places API
  * Google Maps Geocoding API
  * Google Maps Roads API
* Logging 
  * Log4J
* Hosted on amazon web services
* Unit Testing with junit
